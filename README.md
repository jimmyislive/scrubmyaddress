This is a weekend project I made to standardize addresses via hooking up with the USPS API.

You will first need to contact USPS for a USPS username.

The project is hosted on Heroku @ scrubmyaddress.com (as long as I own the domain name)

Screenshots of the finished products are available in the demo dir.
